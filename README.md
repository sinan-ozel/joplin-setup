# Joplin Setup

I record all of my Joplin setup in this repo, including scripts. I could turn these into extension or apps some day, but for now, they are only for personal use. If somebody wants to use them for their open source projects, they are welcome to.

This code updates a custom table on a specific note on the WebDAV server directly. There is a speciifc format for tracking the blood pressure, found on the inline comments in the code.
